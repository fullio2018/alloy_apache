# Grafana Agent Alloy Configuration for Apache Metrics

## Introduction
This repository contains a configuration for the `Grafana Agent Alloy v1.5.1`, that allows collecting status metrics from an Apache instance. Additionally, it extracts the response times from all the requests processed and logged in the access.log. The final step is to process everything and send it to a backend for storage and analysis.

## Challenge
The challenge was to create a configuration that:

- Collects status metrics from an Apache instance.
- Extracts response times from all the requests processed and logged in the access.log.
- Processes the collected using Loki and OTEL Components data and sends it to a backend for storage and analysis.
  
## Solution
The solution involves using the Grafana Agent Alloy and playing with all the pieces that the Grafana team has made available to us. The configuration allows sending data to Loki or other destinations.
